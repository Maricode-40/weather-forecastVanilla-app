## Objective🎯

This Weather Forecast application will provide you with accurate day-to-day data and real-time information about weather from other cities which can help you to make better decisions about your dayly day activities.

## About the project-🔎

I mainly worked with tools such as Bootstrap, html5, CSS3, ES6, and flex to create this Responsive and Minimalistic Weather App.

I have also included some Vanillla javascript functions to create the Search Engine & API that will give you the accurate Forecast data of the city you search for.

The project is hosted on Netlify.
